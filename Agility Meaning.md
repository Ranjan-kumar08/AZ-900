#AGILITY meaning in cloud computing with example
I am  running a small online store that sells custom T-shirts. My website is hosted on a cloud platform.
How agility in cloud computing can benefit you:

Scalability: During the holiday season, you experience a surge in traffic as more customers visit your site to buy gifts.
With cloud computing, you can easily scale up your server resources to handle the increased load.
After the holiday rush, you can scale down to save costs. This ensures that your website remains fast and responsive, providing a good user experience.

Flexibility: Suppose you decide to expand your product line to include custom hoodies and mugs.
The cloud platform allows you to quickly deploy new applications or services to manage the new products.
You can easily integrate these services with your existing setup without extensive reconfiguration.

Speed: You want to launch a marketing campaign for a flash sale. 
With cloud computing, you can quickly provision the necessary resources, such as additional servers and databases, to support the campaign.
This allows you to respond rapidly to market opportunities and execute your plans without delays.

Cost Efficiency: Instead of investing in expensive hardware upfront, you pay for the cloud resources you use.
This pay-as-you-go model helps you manage costs effectively, especially during periods of fluctuating demand.

In this way, cloud computing's agility allows your online store to quickly adapt to changing business needs, scale resources efficiently, and stay competitive in the market.
